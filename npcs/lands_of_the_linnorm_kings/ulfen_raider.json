            "html": "Raiders from the Linnorm Kingdoms seek to prove themselves by sailing to distant lands and returning with riches, either obtained by shrewd trading or taken as plunder from a successful raid. All raiders seek to show their courage in battle, fighting fiercely for pillage or honor.<br/><br/>While raiding, these barbarians employ the element of surprise; in the faint predawn light, they quietly row their longship with muff led oars as they draw near the targeted settlement. Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines. They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff opposition.<br/><br/>After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate highpedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves are often harvested from the ranks of a village\u2019s ablebodied youths. While Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can provide more plunder in the next raiding season.<br/><br/>In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these bloodthirsty raiders."
