            "html": "In the days of Ancient Osirion, when temples to the old gods still stood throughout the nation, worshipers of Set protected their places of worship with imposing constructs. To allow the priests of these old gods to devote their time and energy to ecclesiastical duties, Set\u2019s clerics designed these foul sentinels to be self-sufficient by using a combination of necromantic techniques and golem crafting.<br/><br/>The clerics and crafters preparing the constructs would begin with the body of an evil desert giant\u2014preferably one who, like them, revered Set. The crafters would then fashion headpieces out of brass, bronze, or iron that were sculpted in the likeness of the god of darkness, deserts, murder, and storms. The headpiece would then be lacquered a glossy black, and set with expensive gemstones indicative of the type of elemental spirit used to animate the construct. After the headpiece was crafted, the preserved desert giant would be decapitated and the headpiece aff ixed to its shoulders.<br/><br/>The towering constructs stood within the sanctuaries of Set\u2019s great temples across the empire, and were often posted at the temple\u2019s exterior doors when the faithful were called to worship. The laity always assumed that the constructs were undead servants crowned with metal helms of their god, and the clergy did nothing to disabuse them of this conceit. Indeed, adventurers often make the same mistake. Opponents can use Knowledge (religion) to identify a Set guardian\u2019s true nature and learn about the construct\u2019s unholy weaknesses.<br/><br/>During the dark decades of Hakotep\u2019s reign, the guardians were a common\u2014and for many, terrifying\u2014sight, for the pharaoh used them as tools to threaten and cow the priesthoods of cults opposed to his religious reforms favoring Set. Today, these constructs have fallen out of favor in ecclesiastical circles\u2014few of the modern cults employ them, though a couple of the surviving temples formerly dedicated to Set still boast one of these giant wardens. Most encounters with Set guardians today are reported by archaeological parties exploring lost temples or the tombs of long-buried nobles who had some devotion to the god in life. Once frightening attendants in temples across the land, they now wait in darkness for those unwisely disturbing ancient burial sites.<br/><br/>Set guardians stand a towering 18 feet tall and weigh approximately 12,000 pounds."
