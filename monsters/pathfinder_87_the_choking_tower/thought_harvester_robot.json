Built to survive battlefields and other hazardous environments, thought harvesters are outf itted with thick armor plating and a durable force field. Giving the thought harvester robot its name, two prehensile tendrils extend from the creature\u2019s sides, each tipped with a wickedly barbed syringe through which the creature injects sophisticated nanites into its target. These nanites immediately duplicate portions of the target\u2019s brain and return through the syringe into the thought harvester\u2019s central core. There, the target\u2019s memories are swiftly categorized and stored in one of an array of crystalline spheres located along the robot\u2019s spine. When performed on a living target, the process is painful and can cause severe damage to the subject\u2019s cognitive reasoning capabilities. A thought harvester\u2019s head has a single glowing eye in the center, and two weapons hang beneath it. These weapons allow the thought harvester to fire bursts of sonic energy at any targets that react in an aggressive manner. A thought harvester rarely speaks, but when it does it speaks in short, monosyllabic words, and is always direct and to the point. Thought harvesters are 6 feet long and 4 feet tall. They are densely built, and weigh 1,600 lbs. A thought harvester draws energy from an eff icient internal power source and continually recycles and repairs its internal store of specialized nanites."

A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effects of this ability; mindless creatures or creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 are immune to it. Each time a creature\u2019s memories are copied through the use of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain. A creature\u2019s Intelligence score can\u2019t be drained below 1 in this way.<br/><br/> If successful, the target\u2019s copied memories appear as swirling mist within one of the crystal spheres socketed into the thought harvester\u2019s back. If the thought harvester is willing, helpless, or destroyed, a sphere can be removed from its socket with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check and be read by certain devices without damaging the memories within. This ability can be used on creatures that have been dead for less than 24 hours, but their brain must be mostly intact and only 1d4 memories can be harvested postmortem. The duration can be extended if the creature\u2019s brain has been preserved (such as by <i>gentle repose</i>) or if the creature possesses a brain that doesn\u2019t rot.
