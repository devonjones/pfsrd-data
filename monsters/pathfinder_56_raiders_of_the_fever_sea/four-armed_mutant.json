The unusual and typically deadly mutants common to the race attest to this, their forms altering and becoming more deadly based either on the needs of the community or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the case, sahuagin mutants often rise to positions of respect and inf luence in sahuagin communities, their innate advantages instantly placing them among their people\u2019s rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed sahuagin brutes and malenti\u2014 sahuagin with the appearances of sea elves\u2014arise most commonly, though these are in no way the only sahuagin mutants known to the savage seas."

As sahuagin are such common menaces over the course of the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path, their variants are included here to make encounters with the shark people even more unpredictable and deadly.<br/><br/><b>Four-Armed Sahuagin</b>: These mutants gain Multiattack and Toughness as bonus feats and the multiweapon mastery ability. These changes do not include an increase in such a mutant\u2019s Hit Dice, but do increase its CR to 3. Despite the advantages these additions give the creature, its hit points are on the low side for a CR 3 monster. GMs should consider giving four-armed sahuagin armor considerably better than that usually worn by CR 3 monsters to make up for this relative glass jaw. Giving the creature leather armor (or an aquatic equivalent, such as shark leather armor) grants it a +2 armor bonus, increasing its AC to 18\u2014above the average for its CR, but a considered benefit to help balance out its weakness. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, rangers, and warriors.<br/><br/><b>Malenti</b>: These mutants gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, Deceitful and Skill Focus (Bluff ) as bonus feats, and <i>command </i>as a spell-like ability (representing increased telepathic influence over aquatic creatures). Additionally, a malenti\u2019s natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. The benefits a malenti gains largely offset those it loses, resulting in no change to the creature\u2019s CR. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards."

The following mutants are also sometimes found in sahuagin societies. While rarer than other mutants, they too quickly garner the respect and fear of their piscine brethren.<br/><br/><b>Prehistoric Sahuagin</b>: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to some even more savage epoch; they are Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with aquatic dinosaurs and megafauna in addition to sharks. They are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures or waters that are somehow strangely affected by the flow of time.<br/><br/><b>Shark-Blooded Sahuagin</b>: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of sharklike teeth, and the fins and tail of an oversized thresher shark (or other local variety). These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a swim speed of 80 feet, and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. Sharkblooded sahuagin are most typically found in sahuagin communities with unusually high numbers of shark guardians and near shark breeding grounds.<br/><br/><b>Spined Sahuagin</b>: Covered in hundreds of needlelike spines, these sahuagin can raise these piercing protrusions to impale creatures that attempt to grab or consume them. Any creature that grapples a spined sahuagin takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training as a bonus feat. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive aquatic predators."
