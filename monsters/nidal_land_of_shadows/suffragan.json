The suffragan's configuration of chains affects its number of attacks, its reach, its base speed, and its climb speed, in addition to affecting other statistics or granting additional abilities, depending on the configuration. The configurations available to the suffragan are described below, and the suffragan retains the selected configuration until it spends a swift action to change it. Most suffragans frequently use the old form configuration, which is reflected in the statistics above.<br/><br/><i>Midnight's Blessing Configuration</i>: The suffragan rolls onto its back and extends all of its chains and whips to their full lengths. The kyton can make up to eight bladed limb attacks each round and has a reach of 10 feet. Its base speed and climb speed are 5 feet.<br/><br/><i>Old Form Configuration</i>: The suffragan uses the chains and whips sprouting from the stumps of its amputated legs to walk. The kyton can make up to four bladed limb attacks each round and gains the trip special ability with its bladed limb attacks. Its base speed and climb speed are both 30 feet, and it gains a +4 bonus to its CMD against trip combat maneuvers.<br/><br/><i>Prowler Configuration</i>: The suffragan uses most of its chains and whips for locomotion while hunched low to the ground like a beetle. The kyton can make up to two bladed limb attacks each round. Its base speed and climb speed are both 50 feet, and it gains the pounce ability as well as a +8 bonus to its CMD against bull rush, reposition, or trip combat maneuvers.<br/><br/><b>Slow Fall (Ex)</b> A suffragan in any configuration can use its bladed whips and chains to slow its fall. When within reach of a wall, a suffragan can slow its descent and fall any distance without harm."

Suffragans display an uncanny ability to reconfigure their barbed limbs to suit any task at hand. When desperate or when fighting a cornered foe, most suffragans roll onto their backs to strike with a tempest of chains and whips. Albeit uncommon, other suffragan configurations include wings or fins made of interlocked limbs.<br/><br/> A suffragan\u2019s face is as much a horrific fusion of metal and flesh as its body. Barbed blades droop from its mouth, its tongue replaced with jagged metal that undulates eerily.<br/><br/> Like all kytons, suffragans delight in inflicting terror and suffering, particularly upon the pure and weak. They enjoy giving captives small, overlapping, painful lashes with their barbs and blades. Suffragans often refer to their torturous work as blessings they are bestowing on their cruel god\u2019s behalf, though their words are garbled around their mouth blades.<br/><br/> A suffragan kyton stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.<br/><br/>"
