            "html": "For thousands of years after it became trapped in Crystilan, Xin-Edasseril existed apart from planar space and time. While the city remained safe from intrusion, its residents were unaware that they were trapped within a temporal prison, replaying the same week-long period over and over. The city\u2019s inhabitants never aged, but the souls of those who died couldn\u2019t escape to the Boneyard. Instead, these trapped souls festered within the demiplane, and over the course of centuries transformed into terrifying, incorporeal undead creatures called chronogeists.<br/><br/> With each week\u2019s reset, the citizens of Crystilan who had perished in the previous incarnation of the city simply vanished from the memories of those who survived, their passage from life to death wiped clean due to the nature of time within the demiplane being constantly reset. Yet sometimes, people would vaguely recall those who had perished in the form of half-remembered dreams, and as the presence of chronogeists slowly grew, theories as to their nature began to spread through the city\u2019s scholars. Some correctly suspected they were tied to a distortion in time, but most believed they were manifestations of dreams or forgotten memories that sought vengeance upon those who had misremembered them. Of course, at the end of every week, with the resetting of time, these theories would all be forgotten.<br/><br/> Over the years, the number of citizens in Xin-Edasseril slowly decreased while chronogeists continued to manifest. Fortunately for the city\u2019s inhabitants, once a chronogeist was slain, it didn\u2019t return to life with the next week\u2019s reset\u2014instead, this trapped spiritual energy simply got absorbed into the shell surrounding Crystilan.<br/><br/> This growing spiritual pressure on the demiplane\u2019s borders is yet another factor that led to its recent destabilization when the Sihedron Heroes harvested energy from the demiplane\u2019s shell using the <i>Timeglass</i>.<br/><br/> Now that time once again flows forward normally, newly dead souls in Crystilan don\u2019t become trapped and are free to enter the Boneyard normally. Yet for the hundreds of souls still trapped in a strange limbo as a chronogeist, only the destruction of Crystilan itself can allow their escape to the afterlife.<br/><br/> Chronogeists are incorporeal, and their forms typically resemble far more wicked and angry versions of their appearance before undeath. Unhealthy, pale yellow, or orange lights typically permeate chronogeists, though they flash a gamut of bright colors when they harness the unstable time within them to attack those who disturb them. Chronogeists typically wear ghostly vestments of the clothes they wore when they died or clothing that was heavily associated with them in life, such as a priest\u2019s robes or a soldier\u2019s uniform."

Affected creatures take 6d6 points of damage (this damage occurs from rapid aging and cell death and doesn\u2019t have a damage type). A successful DC 26 Will save negates this damage. Any creature who fails the save is also nauseated for 1 round as a result of the disorienting attack. The chronogeist can use this ability three times per day, but not more often than once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. "

For the next 3 rounds, affected creatures can move at only half speed, and take a \u20138 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based checks and abilities, including AC, ranged and melee attack and damage rolls, and skill checks. A creature affected by a chronogeist\u2019s temporal screech (whether or not its saving throw was successful) can\u2019t be affected by it again for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic effect.
