A non-goblinoid creature that takes damage from a hobbe hound\u2019s bite, deals damage to a hobbe hound with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise comes into contact with a hobbe hound (including attempts to grapple or ride the creature) must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or break out in an itchy rash. A creature affected by this rash takes a \u20132 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma for 24 hours (multiple allergic reactions do not stack). <i>Remove disease</i> or any form of magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br/><br/><b>Flammable (Ex)</b> The greasy, alchemical musk that constantly coats a hobbe hound\u2019s body is highly flammable, and if ignited by an open flame or a spell that deals any amount of fire damage, it burns for 10 rounds. While burning, the hobbe hound deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with its natural attacks, and creatures striking it with natural weapons or unarmed strikes, or attempting to grapple the hobbe hound, take 1d6 points of fire damage. The hobbe hound takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round it remains on fire, but its energy resistance applies normally. Extinguishing a hobbe hound requires the beast to either succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw as a full-round action or complete immersion in water.<br/><br/> A hobbe hound that has been set on fire loses its allergic reaction special ability for 24 hours while its body replenishes the irritating oils that have been burned away."

            "html": "Standing 3 feet tall and weighing nearly 150 pounds each, hobbe hounds are disposable war dogs of hobgoblin armies. Cowed only by shows of violence, they are loathsome and miserable creatures that return savagery in kind. The thick, waxy musk that constantly oozes from their pockmarked skin reeks of death and urine, and is highly irritating to non-goblinoids. Far worse, their fetid coating bursts into flame with the slightest spark, and while most armies would find flammable shock troops to be a hindrance, efficient and cruel hobgoblins find burning, baying, savage beasts of war ideal for breaking enemy ranks and sowing chaos before their own regiments close to melee.<br/><br/> Hobbe hounds first appeared in Avistan during the Goblinblood Wars, when the beasts were unleashed against Andoren Eagle Knights along the war\u2019s southern front. The hobgoblins of the Chitterwood often intentionally set their own chargers ablaze, unleashing entire walls of flaming savagery upon the panicked soldiers. In the years since, surviving war beasts have formed feral packs in Isger, Molthune, and Cheliax, while hobgoblin tribes across the Inner Sea region have begun breeding their own stocks of the monsters."
