            "html": "<b>Daytime Invisibility (Su)</b> During the day, a tuyewera is invisible as long as it doesn\u2019t attack. This effect functions as the <i>invisibility</i> spell, but lasts for the entire day. If a tuyewera takes any action that would negate its invisibility (such as attacking), it remains visible until it takes a full-round action to reactivate its invisibility.<br/><br/><b>Lure (Su)</b> If a tuyewera possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it can lure creatures into a trancelike state and compel them to approach as a standard action. When a tuyewera uses its lure, it must target an intelligent creature within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight). The tuyewera must concentrate to maintain the lure\u2019s effects. It then calls out to the creature, beckoning it to approach. The target can resist this lure by making a successful DC 15 Will save, after which that target is immune to that tuyewera\u2019s lure ability until the tuyewera gains a different tongue. If the tuyewera uses the target\u2019s name during the lure, the target suffers a \u20132 penalty on the Will save. If the target fails, she becomes fascinated and attempts to approach the tuyewera by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the target is adjacent to the tuyewera, she remains motionless and offers no resistance to the undead\u2019s attacks (although once the tuyewera attacks, it ceases concentration and the victim is free to act, assuming she survives the monster\u2019s attack). This is a sonic mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br/><br/><b>Suffocation (Su)</b> A tuyewera does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal the breath of a helpless, fascinated, or stunned adjacent creature as a standard action. When the tuyewera attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the victim\u2019s mouth and inhales, drawing the victim\u2019s breath out of her body. The victim can attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude save. If she fails, the victim is stunned for 1 round and begins to suffocate. The victim falls unconscious on the second round, drops to \u20131 hit points on the third, and dies of suffocation on the fourth. Each round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to end the suffocation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br/><br/><b>Steal Tongue (Su)</b> A tuyewera does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created\u2014it must steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature before it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or constriction attacks. Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after which the stolen tongue merges with the tuyewera\u2019s jaw. The tuyewera gains the ability to speak and understand all of the languages known by the dead body from which the tongue was harvested, and its voice sounds exactly like that of the dead creature while it still lived. The monster\u2019s new tongue is a dangerous weapon as well, and can extend to a length of nearly 5 feet to attack and constrict foes. A stolen tongue only lasts until the next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round, forcing the tuyewera to seek out a replacement before it regains its speech and attacks."

Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can be sent into an enemy\u2019s lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead\u2014in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse\u2019s tongue at the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing their tongues to repeat the process."
