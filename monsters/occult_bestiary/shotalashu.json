            "html": "Within the alien beauty of the jungles of Castrovel lie untold dangers, as the planet\u2019s wild flora and fauna vie dramatically for dominance. To maintain order and security in their settlements, Castrovel\u2019s native lashunta required steeds with power, speed, and an instinctive knack for traversing the planet\u2019s thick jungles. No creature met these requirements better than the shotalashu, large reptilian creatures that maintained a relatively high place in their ecosystem\u2019s food chain and yet were strangely receptive to the lashunta\u2019s initial friendly overtures. Once incorporated into lashunta society, the shotalashu and their riders quickly became iconic symbols of lashunta culture.<br/><br/>Sometimes called \u201cshota\u201d for short, shotalashu possess rudimentary telepathic abilities similar to those of the lashunta, so taming the beasts and training them to be mounts proved relatively simple\u2014in fact, the first shotalashu mounts surprised their lashunta riders with their enthusiasm for the partnership. Once linked, a shotalashu carries out the will of its rider effortlessly, often seeming to anticipate her desires and directions before she conveys them.<br/><br/>While it\u2019s common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashu throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount for life. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashu who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years. Though they might accept other riders for short periods of time, the bereaved creatures don\u2019t seem to communicate as well until they have ceased grieving and bonded with a new rider, and might even be withdrawn and uncommunicative with other shotalashu during their grieving period.<br/><br/>A typical shotalashu is over 10 feet long from snout to tail-tip, and weighs more than 1,000 pounds."
