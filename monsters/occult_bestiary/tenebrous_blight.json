Tenebrous blights instinctively attack any creatures that disturb them, weakening intruders with the harrowing effects of their spores and lashing out with their shadowy tendrils. Xulgaths (see page 61) are the only known creatures that can safely disturb a tenebrous blight\u2019s spores\u2014a sideeffect of the reptilian humanoids\u2019 psychogenic secretions. Xulgaths often use tenebrous blights as guardians and obstacles to impede trespassers in their territory. Tenebrous blights are 25 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds."
