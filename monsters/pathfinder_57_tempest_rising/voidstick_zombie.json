            "html": "The voidstick zombie is the hateful creation of wicked shamans and necromancers, who use <i>voidsticks </i>to animate the dead. One <i>voidstick </i>is required for every Hit Die possessed by the base creature. These vile devices, each of which is 6 to 10 inches in length, are pierced through the living or dead body of a creature, pumping the dark energy of the void into its form. Packed with the bitter entropy of negative energy, the creature rises, seeking out the life force of others with endless sadness and insane determination. Its single goal is to extinguish life and smother any source of positive energy. Multiple <i>voidsticks</i> in a creature\u2019s form feed one another, augmenting their standard abilities and imbuing the touch of the voidstick zombie with the power to drain life from anything it touches. The zombie becomes almost a sliver of the void itself, existing in a state of such negative power that its very proximity can tamper with other creatures\u2019 abilities to summon the powers of the Positive Energy Plane, and with the perpetual sadness that numbs its own intellect it gains the power to enhance and influence other creatures that depend on negative energy.<br/><br/>These sad creatures, wracked with soulless negative energy, constantly hunger for destruction, delighted at every chance they get to snuff the spark of life from the living. They hunt the islands throughout the Shackles, especially the Cannibal Isles, where their creation began long before its current inhabitants made their home there.<br/><br/>As the brutal and savage kuru people of the Cannibal Isles explored the ruins of Ghol-Gan, they discovered the foul magic involved with the <i>voidsticks</i>, and as they turned to barbarism and cannibalism, their shamans carved these devices and created the first voidstick zombie seen on Golarion in thousands of years. The kuru use voidstick zombies for war against each other and to serve as ruthless hunters, culling humanoids who wander too close to their blood-drenched islands. Kuru shamans create the vile <i>voidsticks </i>in order to enhance their own necromantic strength as well as to animate voidstick zombies. In some tribes it is seen as a great honor to be transformed into one of these powerful creatures, and some aged shamans on the eve of their death elect to undergo this transformation instead of becoming a ritual meal for their tribes.<br/><br/>Since the rediscovery of <i>voidsticks</i>, those interested in necromancy and the creation of new undead have sent emissaries to the Shackles eager to buy them. These enterprising necromancers experiment with the devices and unleash voidstick zombies into Avistan and Garund to fulfill their murderous intent."

As with all <i>voidsticks</i>, an aura of intense negative energy extends in a 30-foot radius from the zombie functioning as the spell <i>desecrate</i>. Undead within this aura receive a +1 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls and the DC to resist channeled negative energy increases by +3. The voidstick zombie constantly gains the benefits of this effect (the attack and damage bonuses are already incorporated into its statistics).<br/><br/>In addition, this miasma of void energies also interferes with wielding positive energy. Any creature attempting to use positive energy in this area\u2014such as through a cleric\u2019s channel energy ability, a paladin\u2019s lay on hands, or any spell with the healing descriptor\u2014must make a DC 25 concentration check. If this check fails, the effect is blocked, consuming one use of the ability, or the spell is lost."
