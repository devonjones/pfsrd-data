A magnetite golem\u2019s humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator\u2019s instructions, and, like most golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate matters, a magnetite golem emits a magnetic field, which forcefully pulls metallic objects closer\u2014including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to pull themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming creatures that rely on metal equipment.<br/><br/>Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately 1,500 pounds."
