They typically try to get close to their victims before attacking, hiding the monstrous elements of their appearance with hooded cloaks or voluminous robes, or lying in wait along darkened trails. They avoid attacking groups that heavily outnumber them, preferring to patiently track potential prey and strike when they can take victims one at a time. <br/><br/>Nocturnal creatures, tenomes often travel miles from their lairs under the cover of night to terrorize rural communities. They typically rotate their hunting grounds and try to cover their tracks when farmers organize to defend their lands or locate the tenomes\u2019 lairs. Their preferred diet of liquefied bones results in hideous corpses that can cause incredible fear in communities, and tenomes know this\u2014they often seek to leave their boneless victims on display where they know the disgusting bodies will soon be found to deter pursuit. <br/><br/>Certain folktales suggest that tenomes originated as a supernatural punishment for a community that did not adequately care for its elderly. Whatever their true genesis was, these frightening monsters can now be found throughout the world, although they prefer to dwell in the fringes of urban regions. A tenome stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs around 150 pounds."

An opponent that fails a DC 14 Will save is frightened if it is the target of a single eye\u2019s gaze, or paralyzed if it is the target of both eyes. These effects last for 1d3 rounds. A tenome must activate its gaze attack; opponents need not attempt saving throws if they otherwise meet the tenome\u2019s gaze. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this ability, it is immune to that tenome\u2019s terrifying gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based."
