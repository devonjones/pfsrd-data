            "html": "Though they resemble humble tumbleweed, bloodbrushes are animate and aggressive. Movement draws its attention, especially when accompanied by warmth and moisture. When it strikes prey, it latches on and delivers a sedating toxin through its barbs. Victims that succumb to this poison experience vivid hallucinations as the bloodbrush finishes them off. As much a drug as a poison, refined bloodbrush toxin commands a high price in the right circles. A single bloodbrush provides sufficient poison to refine 1d4 doses of bloodbrush extract (see page 23), and counts as the raw materials for the process.<br/><br/>Bloodbrush thorns deposit seeds, though the seeds germinate only in dead flesh. A single corpse sprouts 2d4 seedlings. After 3 months of growth, the now-mature and animate bloodbrush breaks free of its roots and rolls off in search of prey. Prior to this, an immature bloodbrush is neither animate nor toxic. A bloodbrush lives for up to 6 months after tearing free, and can survive 2 weeks between feedings. Despite its size, a mature bloodbrush plant weighs 5 pounds at most.<br/><br/>Kellids harvest the thorns of immature bloodbrushes. They grind the dried thorns, and brew the resulting powder as a tea with mild euphoric and fever-reducing properties. Harvesting the thorns and preparing the tea requires a successful DC 15 Survival check. Drinking this tea grants a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against an ongoing disease for 24 hours.<br/><br/>Particularly ingenious tribes, and even some members of the Technic League, cultivate bloodbrush in the shallowly buried corpses of their fallen enemies. When a farmed bloodbrush is near maturity, the grower places a sturdy wicker cage about it to prevent it from escaping. Such cages can be completely sealed and carried into battle or covertly placed in a rival settlement. When released, the captive bloodbrush tends to attack the nearest target, so using one as a weapon presents significant risks to the one who releases it."
