The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq\u2019s creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes <i>invisibility </i>in this manner. <i>Erase </i>can destroy a tupilaq\u2019s scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq\u2019s scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq\u2019s creator becomes the target of the tupilaq\u2019s seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq\u2019s creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.<br/><br/><b>Seek Target (Su)</b> A tupilaq\u2019s creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature\u2019s body in the tupilaq\u2019s maw as a standard action. From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that creature is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead.<br/><br/><b>Shearing Jaws (Ex)</b> All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a successful bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19\u201320. A tupilaq is treated as Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent."

A tupilaq\u2019s appearance can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds.<br/><br/>Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy\u2014if any other person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit\u2019s previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous."
