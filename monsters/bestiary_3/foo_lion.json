Nonetheless, certain foo creatures are more common than others, and the most often encountered of all are dogs and lions.<br/><br/>A foo creature can be called to the Material Plane for any reason a conjurer can imagine\u2014these monsters are generally much more intelligent than their mundane counterparts, and can not only follow complex orders but can speak and converse as well. Typically, a foo creature is contacted to serve for a time as a guardian\u2014by adopting its statue form using its freeze ability, a foo creature can appear as little more than an ornate decoration astride the facade of a building or standing guard over a fountain in a city plaza. They are not as often called upon to serve as soldiers in armies, for foo creatures detest war. They generally dislike serving as mounts as well, although for particularly pious and kindly folk, they have been known to make exceptions."

            "html": "Among foo creatures there exist what are known as the \u201cimperials\u201d\u2014the leaders of particular races of foo creatures. Imperial foo creatures are much more powerful than the typical examples of their kind, and possess a wide array of additional magical powers. Each imperial foo creature is a unique entity; only one exists at any one time. When an imperial foo creature is slain, the next most powerful foo creature of its species immediately transcends to this role to replace the one that was lost. <br/><br/> To create an imperial foo creature, first generate the statistics for a regular foo creature. The steps you\u2019ll go through to create the imperial version of that foo creature are more akin to those you\u2019d go through to advance a creature by Hit Dice rather than a standard template. <br/><br/><b>Step One\u2014Increase Ability Scores</b>: Upon becoming an imperial, the foo creature gains a +6 bonus to all of its ability scores, save for Intelligence, which increases to 20 (unless the +6 increase would normally increase its Intelligence to an even higher score, in which case use that score instead). <br/><br/><b>Step Two\u2014Advance Hit Dice</b>: An imperial foo creature always has at least double the original foo creature\u2019s Hit Dice\u2014you can give the imperial foo creature even more Hit Dice than this if you want to make a particularly powerful one. Base attack bonus, saves, skill ranks, feats, and all other variables dependant upon Hit Dice change as normal. <br/><br/><b>Step Three\u2014Increase Size</b>: Increase the foo creature\u2019s size by one category, applying the modifiers for size changes. <br/><br/><b>Step Four\u2014Spellcasting</b>: An imperial foo creature casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for an imperial foo creature. The imperial foo creature gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, but gains no other class ability normally granted by the sorcerer class. <br/><br/><b>Step Five\u2014Determine CR</b>: Compare the foo creature\u2019s statistics to determine the creature\u2019s final CR. An imperial foo creature has a minimum CR score of 11. If your creation\u2019s statistics aren\u2019t good enough to qualify for this CR minimum, continue adding racial Hit Dice until the imperial\u2019s statistics reach this minimum."
