While dispersed, the swarm deals no damage and may not use its special abilities, but it is able to immediately hide in plain sight with a +10 bonus and takes only the standard amount of damage from area effects. Once dispersed, it takes the swarm 2 rounds to coalesce again, during which time it cannot attack. A granule construct swarm can remain in its dispersed state indefinitely.<br/><br/><b>Distraction (Ex)</b> Any living creature that begins its turn with a granule construct swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save of be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br/><br/><b>Hive Mind (Ex)</b> Any granule construct swarm with at least 1 hit point per hit die forms a hive mind, giving it an intelligence of 6. When a granule construct swarm is reduced below this threshold, it becomes mindless. In addition, a granule construct swarm shares its collective consciousness with any granule construct hosts within 100 feet. As long as it remains in contact, the hosts cannot be flanked, and if one of them is aware of an enemy, they all are.<br/><br/><b>Infest (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a granule construct swarm may attempt to infest a living creature whose square it inhabits. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or gain the granule construct host template, as a portion of the granule construct swarm invades and begins reproducing inside its body. The transformation takes 1 minute, during which time the host is incapacitated as its body warps and spasms. A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast on a granule construct host forces the swarm to abandon the body, removing the template. The save DC is Constitution-based."

            "html": "Granule construct swarms are the product of powerful artificers pushing the boundaries of their craft. Alone, each individual is a barely sentient construct so tiny as to be practically invisible, a speck of dust that moves under its own power. Brought together by the thousands into a swarm, however, the complex linking of simple systems creates an emergent consciousness of humanlike intelligence, although alien enough to make communication nearly impossible. Granule construct swarms exist solely to infest larger living organisms and reproduce in the relative safety and comfort provided by their bodies. Capable of repairing and replicating out of the raw elements around them, granule constructs within a host are almost unstoppable through physical means, burrowing their way into flesh and sending signals through the bloodstream. Once safely ensconced, granule construct swarms modify their hosts to maximize survival potential, a trait that leads certain people to intentionally cultivate granule construct swarms inside themselves, despite the resulting deformities. Energy damage to a host damages the granule construct swarm equally, but normal weapon damage does not. Granule constructs can vacate dead or dying creatures whenever they so choose, emerging as a standard swarm.<br/><br/><b>Environment:</b> Although created in arcane laboratories, granule construct swawrms can travel anywhere safe to their host creatures.<br/><br/><b>Typical Physical Characteristics:</b> Up close, each microscopic granule construct appears as a silver sphere with an all-purpose orifice at one end that it uses to gather information, take in nutrients, and focus the electromagnetic charges that propel it through the air. At the opposite end emerges a single manipulator claw. In a swarm, they appear as a dense cloud, somewhere between dust and a shadow, that constantly shifts shape and emits a faint hum."
