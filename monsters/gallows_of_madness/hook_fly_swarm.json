            "html": "<b>Bleed (Ex)</b> A hook fly swarm is made up of a terrible mass of juvenile giant hook flies that have undeveloped, though still terribly sharp, proboscises. Any creature that takes swarm damage from a hook fly swarm also takes 1 point of bleed damage at the beginning of its turn. This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other bleed effects. Bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage.<br/><br/><b>Gestate (Ex)</b> Hook fly swarms are made up of underdeveloped giant hook flies, which stay in swarm form for 1 week. Afterward, the swarm finds a secluded place and builds around itself a cocoon-like pod, which it stays in for 1d4 days. This pod is roughly 5 feet by 5 feet in size, and has AC 11 and 11 hit points. After this gestation period, 1d6 giant hook flies burst from the cocoon as a standard action, fully formed and with all of a giant hook fly\u2019s abilities.<br/><br/>Giant hook flies are terrifying, overgrown insects that thrive on their victims\u2019 fresh blood. In particular, giant hook flies are known for their rampant breeding and fast gestation period. Their reproduction is tied to the blood they drain from victims; the more blood they drink, the quicker they can expel their young\u2014which are threats on their own.<br/><br/>Giant hook flies and their parasitic broods can be found anywhere, from a nest in an abandoned barn to the depths of a neglected basement to untold stretches of wilderness. Naturally, they are attracted to blood, so any place where blood is spilled can become a hook fly breeding ground. Butchers and livestock farmers, in particular, must stay vigilant against these dangerous pests, as even the sighting of a single juvenile hook fly might herald a terrible infestation just weeks or even days away. Blood cultists, too, sometimes find that giant hook flies and their spawn are unwelcome visitors to their lairs. On more than one occasion, giant hook flies and their swarms have unwittingly driven evil creatures from their hiding places, surreptitiously aiding a populace shocked that the cultists have been operating in their midst the entire time. Left unchecked, giant hook flies can overrun small farms or other rural places where individuals capable of ending these infestations might be scarce.<br/><br/>That said, giant hook flies are not particularly compelled to stay together, even if they were members of the same brood. In the absence of a strong blood scent to follow, a swarm of juvenile hook flies moves randomly until it finds a secluded area in which to build its cocoon. Once the adults hatch, each of the unintelligent vermin drifts aimlessly, seeking the scent of blood. However, once rooted, giant hook fly populations can prove maddeningly difficult to fully eliminate. Rumor has it that swarms can be dispersed only with gouts of flame; otherwise enough juvenile hook flies survive for the swarm to reform\u2014and surviving swarms inevitably build cocoons that yield fully formed and dangerous new giant hook flies. A common rural saying goes, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t killed hook flies with fire, you haven\u2019t really killed them at all.\u201d<br/><br/>The process of spawning a hook fly swarm typically kills the swarm\u2019s parent. Those that survive normally live up to another 6 months, but the damage to their abdomens leaves them unable to spawn again. However, tales tell of particularly enormous and resilient giant hook flies that live much longer life spans and take minimal damage from spawning their broods\u2014meaning they can spawn again. Worse, these creatures are said to expel two brood swarms at a time."
