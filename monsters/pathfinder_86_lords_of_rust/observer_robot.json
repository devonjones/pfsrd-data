Because they\u2019re intelligent and able to make their own decisions, observer robots are suited for exploring without supervision, recording their observations so that they can relay the images and sounds to their creators. The outer hull of an observer robot and its wings are covered in a network of tiny screens that can display images of the robots\u2019 surroundings, which grants the observer robot a form of camouflage that allows it to clandestinely observe its subjects.<br/><br/>The statistics above represent the most common observer robots, but some models have enhanced senses that allow them to see in darkness or see invisible creatures. Some even have olfactory sensors that effectively smell their environment and test the surrounding air for impurities that would harm their creators. Observer robots deployed in hostile environments might be outfitted with more formidable weaponry than the standard stun gun and laser torch.<br/><br/>An observer robot is approximately 20 inches long and weighs 8 pounds."

Attacks from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d10 points of fire damage. This damage is not modified further by Strength. An observer robot\u2019s integrated laser torch is mounted on an extending arm that allows it greater reach. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as a weapon to sunder, its damage bypasses hardness up to 20 points, and damage is not halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless the object is particularly fire-resistant. A laser torch\u2019s cutting beam passes through force fields and force effects without damaging the field. Invisible objects and creatures can\u2019t be harmed by a laser torch."

An observer robot can record up to 12 hours of audio and video. An observer robot\u2019s communications can be keyed to a commset<sup>TG</sup> or other similar device, and it can broadcast everything it can see or hear to this device as long as it is within 1 mile. The signal strength can be enhanced with a signal booster<sup>TG</sup>. An observer robot can also transmit its senses to another observer robot. A signal has difficulty penetrating solid barriers. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals. Broadcasting functions like a <i>scrying</i> sensor, allowing the viewer to hear and see what the observer robot is experiencing. The viewer gains the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities the observer robot has tied to its senses (such as low-light vision), but the viewer uses her own Perception skill. This ability doesn\u2019t allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, even if both the observer robot and the viewer possess them."
