The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it\u2019s mimicking is larger than itself, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version of it. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a guise indefinitely, but can\u2019t change to a form other than its own without a visual reference\u2014once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form.

            "html": "Mockingfey originally stem from the otherworldly realm of the fey, where they\u2019re regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures\u2019 pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or \u201cmockingdells,\u201d inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler\u2019s shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly uses its mock ability to appear as a perfect, miniature version of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unflattering manner, mimicking the creature\u2019s tone but chattering only gibberish. <br/><br/>This gibberish is not solely for comic effect. While mockingfey are eager (if distractible) students in most matters and can speak and understand Sylvan when necessary, they generally refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain whatever they wish to describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances. <br/><br/>While many people find mockingfey\u2019s antics irritating, the little creatures can make surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities. When such planar rifts occur between this world and the realm of the fey, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, and their presence in a region can be a reliable indication that such a breach between worlds exists somewhere nearby. In such situations, mockingfey often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of mockingfey! <br/><br/>Mockingfey can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an allied spellcaster. Illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars often find them worth the resulting hassle\u2014if just barely. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have a caster level of 4th or higher to gain a mockingfey familiar. <br/><br/>A mockingfey is 8 inches tall and weighs 2 pounds."
