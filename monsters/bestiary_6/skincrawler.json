They stalk isolated prey, but due to their mindlessness, skincrawlers do not recognize that feeding on a host already infested by other skincrawlers can swiftly shorten the lifespan of their food source. <br/><br/>When a skincrawler\u2019s host dies, the ooze detaches and crawls into the host\u2019s body through a convenient orifice, whereupon it enters the last stages of its life cycle. As the host decays around it, the skincrawler suffuses the host\u2019s flesh; 24 hours after the host\u2019s death, the host\u2019s skin splits apart into a rash of up to a dozen skincrawlers that then slither away to seek new prey. When unattached to a host, a skincrawler appears to be a protoplasmic blob of flesh with visible veins and capillaries. <br/><br/>A skincrawler is about 1 foot square in size and weighs 3 pounds"
