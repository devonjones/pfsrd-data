The typical suspicions persist that it is the result of a mad wizard\u2019s experiments or the deliberate cultivations of druidic sects that have adopted anticivilization philosophies, yet those who have taken the time to truly examine these blood-drinking growths have noted disturbing elements that suggest a darker genesis. These botanists theorize that gluttongrass is seeded by the remnants of a creature that has died from starvation, whether in the wilds or in more urban territories. Indeed, patches of gluttongrass have been discovered flourishing in areas devastated by famine and around settlements whose populations have perished due to food supplies being cut off (such as in times of siege or after raiders have burned local crops). However, it has also been identified growing seemingly at random throughout forested areas and plains, blending in with normal grasses and other foliage, so certainly famine and starvation are not requirements for this plant\u2019s growth. <br/><br/>Whatever its origin, one thing is certain: while a mindless plant, gluttongrass is far from harmless. Well-fed patches of this carnivorous grass average a height of 5 feet, with razor-sharp stalks able to pierce exposed skin with ease. Wary travelers should avoid rushing blindly through tall fields, as smaller patches of gluttongrass have been known to extend their roots toward one another, merging and slowly increasing their collective size, reach, and hunger. Some of the largest gluttongrass fields are suspected to have claimed hundreds of victims over the years."
