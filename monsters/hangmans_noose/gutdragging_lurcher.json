The rotting, putrid intestines that wriggle about the gutdragging lurcher push themselves into the enemy\u2019s mouth (pulping themselves through closed teeth even) and pour down the victim\u2019s throat to choke her to death. Anyone grappled by the lurcher must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. If reduced to below 0 hp, the victim begins to suffocate until the lurcher releases her or she perishes, choking on foulness. The save DC is Strength-based.<br/><br/><b>Corpse Puppets (Su)</b> A lurcher\u2019s entrails may slither down the throat of any fresh corpse it finds (dead no longer than 2 days), animating the body as a zombie under the lurcher\u2019s control. One lurcher cannot control more than its Hit Dice worth of zombies at any one time.<br/><br/><b>Entrails (Ex)</b> A lurcher\u2019s entrails may attack foes up to 20 feet away. In addition, these tentacles \u201csee\u201d just as well as the lurcher and can spot foes around corners. They can also squeeze into small openings or under doors to attack enemies. A lurcher feeds on the viscera of the dead to increase its Hit Dice and reach. For every 3 HD the lurcher has above 5, increase the reach of its entrails by another 10 feet. Old and powerful lurchers often sit within nests of warrens, their disgusting entrails infesting the places and animating corpse puppets to deal with anyone foolish enough to intrude.<br/><br/><b>Improved Grab (Ex)</b> If a gutdragging lurcher strikes an opponent with its entrails it may immediately initiate a grapple without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it succeeds in grappling the foe it immediately invades her mouth and throat with its choking viscera.<br/><br/><b>Nauseating Appearance (Ex)</b> Anyone who sees a gutdragging lurcher, or even its wriggling entrails, must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 round. Success on this save renders the foe immune to this lurcher\u2019s appearance for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based."

Since the creation of this disgusting undead, its taint has spread and now gluttonous humanoids with evil-polluted souls often rise as gutdragging lurchers upon death. A corpulent corpse polluted with evil stirs after death, and its entrails burst free from their fat guts to seek out fresh prey. Lurchers are particularly vile undead who feed on the entrails of the living, often choking their victims to death with their flapping wet tendrils of rotting intestine and then pulling the foe\u2019s guts out through their mouths to add to its wriggling collection of viscera.<br/><br/>Gutdragging lurchers are intelligent foes and some command a sizeable force of corpse puppets. Rumor has it a minor crime lord in Absalom\u2019s Flotsam District, who rules a large subsystem of the sewers there, is actually a lurcher named Vleer."

    "html": "<img src=\"images\\ThreeFiveSymbol.gif\" style=\"margin: 3px 3px 0px 3px\"/><i>A sound like soaked ropes slapping wetly against the floor heralds this thing\u2019s disgusting approach. A corpse slides along the floor, its gut ripped open, a mass of wriggling greasy entrails spilling forth like serpents. The viscera possess an unholy life of their own, pulsating obscenely as they wetly grip doorframes, tables, and anything else to pull the body about, like giant worms dragging their plump meal behind them. The bloated horror ceases its approach. The sloppy intestines seem to sense fresh prey, hovering momentarily before shooting forward with frightening speed.</i>",
