Their fear-inducing bite can cause the stouthearted to lose faith, with the mere threat of them sometimes enough to coerce information out of a torturer\u2019s victim. Bore worms are edible and easily killed with water, though the taste varies from \u201cchicken\u201d to \u201csweaty feet.\u201d<br/><br/> In their juvenile stage, bore worms congregate in an undulating morass of sticky slime. At this stage, they can be prevented from growing into their next stage simply by providing them with a steady food supply. Lack of a food supply triggers their next stage of growth, and the bore worm swarm cannibalizes itself, with one bore worm emerging victorious as a bore worm monarch.<br/><br/> At this point in their lives, bore worm monarchs have a driving need to consume as much as they possibly can, and are able to consume gemstones and metals, building up fat reserves for breeding. Bore worm monarchs excrete a pheromone-heavy acid slime that repels other bore worms, giving the creatures the appearance of being territorial. In truth, bore worms lack the intelligence to truly recognize one location from another, though two bore worm monarchs that get too close to one another risk making a meal of each other as they voraciously feed. Eventually, bore worm monarchs turn on the swarms, eating them until they reach the next and final stage of their lives.<br/><br/> Empress bore worms, the largest and eldest members of the species, live short lives in their final stage of development. Eating their own kind acts to perpetuate their species, and after a week-long torpor, empress bore worms hungrily devour everything in their path to find a suitable spot to nest\u2014and die. They are then eaten from within by the live bore worm swarms they birth, and the fat reserves they built up during their monarch stage serve as fuel at the end of their lives."
