            "html": "Strangely intelligent constructs, the earliest hanshepsus were created during Osirion\u2019s First Age. Hanshepsus were originally built to serve as elite soldiers that never tired, didn\u2019t need to be fed, and were impervious to common attacks. Using secrets stolen from Jistkan golem crafters, Osirion\u2019s own artificers designed hanshepsus to equalize the battlef ield in their clashes against the Jistka Imperium as the two nations carved up northern Garund. Throughout the conf lict, hanshepsus fought in dozens of battles, each time turning the tide in favor of Osirion\u2019s forces as they marched ahead of regular, human soldiers through the hot sands of what is now Thuvia. Hanshepsus stand as tall as an adult human. While they appear lean and muscular, their clay bodies give them additional heft, causing them to weigh in at around 300 pounds.<br/><br/>The process of creating a hanshepsu requires the sacrifice of a willing humanoid to provide not only the life force needed to animate the construct\u2019s body, but also the creature\u2019s intelligence. This allows the hanshepsu to make calculated decisions on the battlefield, and some even commanded humanoid units during battles, implementing clever tactics amid the fray.<br/><br/>Though a hanshepsu is intelligent, it lacks anything approaching a personality. Cold and stoic, hanshepsus don\u2019t hold conversations that involve anything more complicated than answering questions or issuing orders. Any attempt to engage a hanshepsu further results in utter silence and an inexpressive face. Some hanshepsus even shut down in the middle of their limited interactions with others, crossing their arms and changing to their solar disk head.<br/><br/>Despite their lack of personality, some hanshepsus retain traces of their mortal memories, and shout out bizarre non sequiturs in the midst of battle. Crumbling texts from the First Age of Osirion contain reports that, after time, hanshepsus became unpredictable, sometimes turning on their commanders and the other soldiers. This suggested that the process of creating these near-impervious soldiers was flawed in some fashion.<br/><br/>Few hanshepsus have been found in the current age, and they are rarely discovered in large numbers. The process of creating hanshepsus was expensive and required a willing sacrif ice, so only the best and brightest warriors were transformed into these constructs. Because of this, modern scholars believe that fewer than 5,000 hanshepsus were created before the practice fell out of favor, and with the march of time, less than 10 percent of that estimation are believed to be still functional.<br/><br/>Hanshepsus work best when assembled in a unit with other hanshepsus. They work in concert, taking physical cues from one another and rarely needing to verbally communicate. When not charged with leading or when fighting alongside a unit containing humanoids, hanshepsus barely regard other creatures. When at rest, they simply wait for new commands. In fighting units, hanshepsus were often at the front lines of a battle, and they used their increased strength and superior defenses to drive a wedge into enemy units and scatter their ranks, allowing the humanoid soldiers behind them to easily pick off the dispersed soldiers."
