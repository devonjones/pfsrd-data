            "html": "The cave fisher is a highly specialized predator that dwells in caves. The creature\u2019s mode of hunting is unique\u2014it clambers up a cave wall to settle on a ledge or in a crack, typically at a height of at least 30 feet. Ledges overlooking bridges and lower ledges overlooking chasms are favored hunting grounds for the cave fisher. The creature lies in wait until prey approaches within 60 feet, at which point it extrudes a thin cord of silk at blinding speed, lashing at the target as with a whip. The filament is incredibly sticky, and once the fisher strikes food with it, it reels in its meal to feed, trusting its position on a higher ledge to prevent any allies the meal may have from molesting it as it eats. Collections of bones and lengths of discarded filaments are sure signs of cave fisher habitation.<br/><br/>A cave fisher produces its filament from glands in its body; when it reels in a victim, it generally eats the filament along with its meal. It\u2019s impossible to harvest new filaments from a dead cave fisher, but filaments harvested from living ones are incredibly light and strong, functioning as silk rope once the sticky adhesive on a length decomposes (which generally takes 3d6 minutes). A cave fisher\u2019s filament glands are useful in constructing sovereign glue and similar sticky magical items. A single cave fisher\u2019s glands count as 100 gp worth of raw materials, offsetting the total cost of the item\u2019s final creation.<br/><br/>Although cave fishers have many superficial similarities to crabs, they do not fare well in water and aren\u2019t very good swimmers. Nevertheless, many cave fishers lair upon ledges overlooking swift-flowing subterranean rivers, giving them a relatively steady stream of food, especially in cases where such rivers are used as trade routes. Those who ply these rivers frequently travel with a few spare slaves or some unwanted livestock, and when they approach a known cave fisher haunt, they send down the unfortunate animal or slave on a raft to distract the monster\u2019s hunger.<br/><br/>A cave fisher is 7 feet long and weighs 400 pounds."
