The save DC is Constitution-based.<br/><br/><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> An iron golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. <ul> <li>A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the <i>slow </i>spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.</li> <li>A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any <i>slow </i>effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.</li> <li>An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a<i> rusting grasp </i>spell.</li> </ul><b>Powerful Blows (Ex) </b>An iron golem inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19\u201320 with its slam attacks."

It can be sculpted into any shape its creator desires, but it almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon in one hand, though they rarely use these, relying instead on their slam attacks.<br/><br/>An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor.<br/><br/>Although the practice has fallen out of favor in modern times, the ancients of certain powerful civilizations once took great pride in crafting iron golems of tremendous size and strength. These golems, which are never smaller than Huge, still exist in remote parts of the world, mindlessly following the orders of a long-dead empire."
