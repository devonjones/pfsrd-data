The tongue can be removed by succeeding at an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage doesn\u2019t deplete the bogwiggle\u2019s actual hit points). The bogwiggle can\u2019t move more than 10 feet away from the target while attached. It can release its tongue\u2019s grip as a free action. Like a boggard, a bogwiggle can\u2019t pull targets toward it with its tongue.<br/><br/><b>Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A bogwiggle can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a bogwiggle normally."

They appear to be dogsized tadpoles that have stopped halfway through the transformation to full-fledged frogs. A single set of long legs sprouts from a bogwiggle\u2019s bulbous body, and a frilled, whiplike tail protrudes from its back. Barely more intelligent than ordinary dogs, bogwiggles spend the majority of their short, violent lives serving as hunting companions and guard animals for their capricious, toadlike masters.<br/><br/>Bogwiggles can live up to 20 years, but because of swamp predators and the cruelty of their masters, most die long before reaching the age of 10. Bogwiggles always have the same skin tone as the boggards with which they live\u2014typically gray, green, or black. Just as with boggards, bogwiggles lose their coloring as they age, and particularly old bogwiggles are often pale gray or almost white. The average bogwiggle is just under 3-1/2 feet long, not counting the tail\u2014which itself is around 6 feet long. Most bogwiggles weigh roughly 65 pounds, but larger specimens have been reported by adventurers and scholars.<br/><br/>Despite being mistreated by their boggard masters, bogwiggles have a curiously strong affinity for them, and are intensely loyal to their tribes. Some scholars theorize that this fealty is a primitive version of a boggard\u2019s natural tribalism or religious inclinations, yet other observers have suggested that bogwiggles believe themselves capable of transformation into full boggards through unwavering devotion to their boggard superiors."
