It is considered blind beyond 60 feet. It is invulnerable to all sight-based attacks and effects, including gaze attacks.<br/><br/><b>Disease (Ex)</b> A wamp\u2019s bite attack infects those it damages with disease. For most wamps, this is a virulent form of zombie rot, but in some cases, a wamp can inflict foes with other undeath-related contagions, such as ghoul fever.<br/><br/><i>Zombie Rot</i>: Bite\u2014injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 19; <i>onset </i>1 round; <i>frequency </i>12 hours; <i>effect </i>1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; <i>cure </i>2 consecutive saves. Any creature that dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br/><br/><b>Feign Undeath (Ex)</b> Although the wamp is a living creature, it registers as an undead creature for the purposes of the spell <i>detect undead</i>. As a swift action, a wamp can attempt to trick an undead creature into thinking the wamp is itself undead\u2014to do so, it attempts a Disguise check opposed by the target undead creature\u2019s Perception check. A successful Disguise check allows the wamp to maintain the facade against that undead creature for 24 hours before being forced to make a new check. This ability lets the wamp move relatively unhindered among unintelligent undead, but intelligent undead who understand the threat a wamp presents are unlikely to be fooled by this deception for long. This ability does not allow the wamp to be healed by negative energy; it is harmed by such attacks (and healed by positive energy) as per normal for a living creature. It does grant the wamp a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks and effects generated by undead creatures, regardless of whether its trickery has worked on that particular undead creature.<br/><br/><b>Swift Infection (Su)</b> All diseases a wamp inflicts on creatures have no onset time, and those who are infected with such a disease must attempt saving throws to avoid its effects twice as frequently as normal for that disease."

A wamp is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The wamp\u2019s face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing opening volley of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death\u2014yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.<br/><br/>A wamp\u2019s body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling stench of rotting flesh."
