A doomed creature gains the shaken condition. An already shaken creature that takes damage from an Ib shade must succeed at a DC 16 Will save to avoid becoming damned instead. A damned creature becomes so haunted by the certainty of its own imminent destruction that it is dazed for 1 round and then staggered for 1d6 rounds thereafter. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br/><br/><b>Ghost Touch (Ex)</b> An Ib shade\u2019s webbed hands can manipulate solid objects (but not creatures) as if the objects had the <i>ghost touch</i> special ability. This allows Ib shades to wield weapons if they desire (although most eschew weaponry in favor of their more dangerous wracking touches) and to work together to carry large objects (such as statues of Bokrug). An Ib shade uses its Charisma score instead of its Strength score for determining how much weight it can carry, lift, or drag.<br/><br/><b>Voiceless (Ex)</b> An Ib shade has no voice and cannot speak or take any verbal action as a result. An Ib shade that gains a level in a spellcasting class automatically replaces any verbal components required by its spells with thought components (see page 144 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> for rules on thought components).<br/><br/><b>Wracking Touch (Su)</b> An Ib shade\u2019s incorporeal touch causes painful wounds that manifest as wracking burns, deep bruises, or, in the case of attacks made against objects or constructs, crumbling fissures. This damage is treated as bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing, but it also counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Against foes who are dazed or shaken by an Ib shade\u2019s doom ability (see above), successful melee attacks are treated as confirmed critical hits. An Ib shade\u2019s wracking touch is a primary touch attack."

These beings dwelt in Ib for ages, worshiping their deity Bokrug and performing their own curious rites and rituals until they were slaughtered by humans who were disturbed by the creatures\u2019 strange appearances and frightening deity. One thousand years later, the ghosts of this slaughtered race rose from the waters of that lake and descended upon the human city of Sarnath, bringing with them a terrible doom that brought death to all and wiped the mighty metropolis from existence, leaving only a swampy shoreline in its wake with the rising of the next sun.<br/><br/>An Ib shade is a nauseating green color. Its hands and feet are webbed and its body limber and lithe, with a sunken belly. The shade\u2019s face is froglike, with wide, flabby lips, but it has no eyes in its overly large eye sockets. Its ears are long and taper to two distinct points that protrude backward from the skull at an angle, with a third point descending downward to the shoulder in place of an earlobe."
