            "html": "<b>Bestial Possession (Su)</b> A vilkacis is a spirit of savagery and can take control of other beings, afflicting them with its savage nature. Once per round, the vilkacis can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a <i>magic jar</i> spell (caster level 10th), except it does not require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours equal to the vilkacis\u2019s Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use this ability, the vilkacis must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vilkacis\u2019s bestial possession for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br/><br/>Upon being possessed by a vilkacis, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably growing claws and vicious fangs, and flies into a savage rage. The victim gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and 1d6 for Medium creatures; see Table 3\u20131 on page 302 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>), and gains a barbarian\u2019s greater rage class ability (see page 31 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). This rage lasts for as long as the victim is being possessed by the vilkacis. After the possession ends, the victim is fatigued for a period of time equal to double the duration of the possession. The victim also gains low-light vision and scent. The possessed creature loses all of these natural attacks and abilities immediately when the vilkacis leaves its body.<br/><br/><b>Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)</b> Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by a vilkacis must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as if bitten by a werewolf. If the victim\u2019s size is not within one size category of the possessed creature\u2019s, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the vilkacis\u2019s ability scores and is Charisma-based.<br/><br/><b>Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)</b> A vilkacis or creature possessed by a vilkacis can communicate and empathize with wolves and dire wolves. It can use its Diplomacy to alter such an animal\u2019s attitude, and when so doing gains a +4 racial bonus on the check.<br/><br/><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after 2d4 days. The only way to permanently do away with a vilkacis is to locate its <i>canopic stone</i>, the occult artifact that binds it to the Material Plane, and then destroy the artifact in the presence of the vilkacis\u2019s mortal remains. Once the <i>canopic stone</i> is destroyed, the vilkacis can no longer rejuvenate and can be destroyed as normal.<br/><br/><b>Vulnerability to Silver (Su)</b> Vilkacis are particularly susceptible to silver. A vilkacis struck with a silver weapon takes an additional 2d6 points of damage. If a creature under the effects of a vilkacis\u2019s bestial possession is damaged by a silver weapon, it also takes this extra damage and receives another saving throw to resist the bestial possession. If successful, the possession ends, and the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use its bestial possession ability again until the following day."

Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal f lesh and again revel in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse\u2014the spirits of the infamous aff liction itself\u2014while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more.<br/><br/>Vilkacis typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and claws."
