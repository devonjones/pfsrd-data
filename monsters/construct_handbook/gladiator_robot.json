            "html": "<b>Adaptive Defensive Programming (Ex)</b> Three times per day as an immediate action, a gladiator robot can change one of its resistances to any other energy type for 1 minute. <br/><br/><b>Boosted Charge (Ex)</b> Twice per day, a gladiator robot can make a full-attack action at the end of a charge instead of a single attack. <br/><br/><b>Dense Structure (Ex)</b> A gladiator robot gains bonus hit points as if it were a construct two sizes larger. <br/><br/><b>Flexible Programming (Ex)</b> Ten times per day as an immediate action, a gladiator robot can gain the benefit of any feat for which it qualifies but does not have. Each feat remains in effect for 1 minute. In addition, it counts its racial Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If it has levels in fighter, these Hit Dice stack with these levels. <br/><br/><b>Integrated Weaponry (Ex)</b> A gladiator robot\u2019s arms have integrated weaponry. These weapons cannot be disarmed, removed, or sundered. A gladiator robot\u2019s programming allows it to wield these weapons as if it were proficient in their use. <br/><br/><i>Adamantine Chainsaw (Ex)</i>: Two of a gladiator robot\u2019s arms link into a motor-driven chainsaw with adamantine cutters and chain. <br/><br/><i>Adamantine Buzz Saw (Ex)</i>: One of a gladiator robot\u2019s arms ends in a spinning blade. <br/><br/><i>Hypersonic Rifle (Ex)</i>: One of a gladiator robot\u2019s arms ends in a powerful rifle that fires metal slugs at hypersonic velocities. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage. A creature struck must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based. <br/><br/><b>Overclocked Targeting (Ex)</b> Gladiator robots operate beyond the limits of stability and safety. A gladiator robot that suffers a critical hit does not become staggered or stunned as is normal for a robot, but it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe. Upon taking a critical hit, the gladiator robot must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. On a success, for the following round it attacks a randomly determined target within 60 feet. On a failed save, it attacks random targets for the following 1d4+1 rounds. <br/><br/><b>Programmed to Entertain (Ex)</b> A gladiator robot gains Intimidate and Perform (gladiator) as class skills and gains a +2 bonus on performance combat checks. <br/><br/><b>Resilient (Ex)</b> Gladiator robots receive a +5 racial bonus on all saving throws. <br/><br/><b>Superior Optics (Ex)</b> Gladiator robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible. <br/><br/><b>Work the Crowd (Ex)</b> Gladiator robots are programmed to reward themselves for victory and showiness. As a swift action after reducing a foe to 0 hit points or otherwise incapacitating it, a gladiator robot can attempt a DC 20 Perform (gladiator) check. If it succeeds, the gladiator robot recovers 4d10 hit points, up to its maximum hit points. This ability functions only if the incapacitating action is observed by a <a href=\"Rules.aspx?Name=City%20Streets&Category=Urban%20Features\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">crowd</a> and must be performed on the same round as felling a foe or the round immediately after."

            "html": "Adaptable in combat and programmed to entertain, gladiator robots are designed to provide a vicarious experience to sate spectators\u2019 primal bloodlust. They fight with a passion that makes many observers forget they are watching a machine instead of a living being. Constructed to move with grace and swagger both in and out of battle, they are agile and incredibly strong for their size. Gladiator robots stand 6 feet tall but are constructed of dense metals and weigh 450 pounds.<br/><br/> Built from some of the rarest high-tech materials and weapons acquired by the Technic League, gladiator robots usually serve as entertainment in the blood- and oil-smeared fighting pits of Starfall in Numeria, although they have been spotted less commonly in Tymon in the River Kingdoms and Oppara in Taldor. Owned almost exclusively by high-ranking members of the Technic League, gladiator robots often operate as personal bodyguards when not participating in gladiatorial combat, although their tendency toward targeting errors makes them risky protectors.<br/><br/> The inherent danger of spectating a gladiatorial contest starring a gladiator robot draws crowds from far and wide, although it necessitates either large, open arenas or protective structures like walls and raised seats to keep the crowd safe. Many cities that normally allow gladiatorial combat have banned competition involving these robots after incidents of audience members being targeted following a lucky hit against the robot.<br/><br/> While most robots behave in a logical and emotionless way, gladiator robots are gregarious, outgoing, and attention-seeking. Their voices are loud, upbeat, and cheerful, and they endlessly narrate their own actions in battle while providing commentary on their opponents and their actions. This attitude and presence stands in sharp contrast to their menacing, heavily-armored chassis and powerful weapons; these disparate elements make for a combination their opponents find unnerving. Spectators, however, love the bluster and braggadocio of a gladiator robot, often waiting after a match in hopes of meeting it. In Oppara, this tradition is taken even further, with young children running up to a victorious gladiator robot with two rags: a clean one to wipe away blood and grime, and an oiled one to shine its armor to brilliance. They then sell these rags to wealthy nobles for a few gold pieces each.<br/><br/> Since their programming has been pushed to the limits of their capacity, gladiator robots are prone to develop quirks and bugs in their behavior. Despite frequently being sent back to technicians for repair, gladiator robots often develop personality traits that begin to blur the line between machines and living creatures. While most of these quirks tend to emulate personalities that are brash and energetic, some gladiator robots become enamored of death. These robots are likely the source of rumors about out-of-control \u201ckill bots\u201d that view killing as pleasure.<br/><br/> Stories of gladiator robots leaving the service of their masters and taking up free lives on their own may be nothing more than Andoren propaganda, but such tales are appealing enough that several have spread throughout the Inner Sea. One famous tale is told by Mendevian Knights who watched a \u201cman of metal\u201d walk directly into hordes of demons near the Worldwound, shouting challenges the entire way. Whether the robot survived\u2014 or the story is true\u2014is unclear."
