            "html": "The echeneis is a magical fish known to sailors in many parts of the world as a major pest due to its theft of speed from boats and large, swimming creatures alike. It ranges across large stretches of water, stopping every few hours to feed and sap velocity from large boats, sharks, whales, and other hosts that might overlook it. Although native to warm waters, echeneises sometimes follow trade vessels elsewhere. Because echeneises prefer murky shallows, sailors rarely notice one before it begins to slow a vessel. The sharp and sturdy spines atop the creatures\u2019 backs scrape the hulls of ships to which they are attached, so sailors lament both the short-term inconvenience and the long-term damage caused by these pests. Old boats with hundreds of scrape marks on their bottoms garner reputations as cursed, and their captains face a serious stigma when trying to recruit crews. It is true that some ships draw echeneises more than others, but apart from the ship\u2019s size there is no indication as to what else might attract the creatures.<br/><br/> Like the remoras they resemble, echeneises are scavengers. However, they are aggressive and often retaliate when knocked off of creatures or vessels. In combat, echeneises attach themselves to enemies to slow them down while flailing with their tails against anyone attempting to remove them. If badly injured while attached, an echeneis releases its victim and uses the speed it has stolen to quickly escape.<br/><br/> An echeneis averages over 3 feet in length and weighs at least 12 pounds."

                "text": "Whenever an echeneis ends its turn attached to a creature or vehicle, it steals fragments of time from its host and gains the benefits of <i>haste</i> for as long as it is attached and for an equal amount of time thereafter (maximum 3 hours). A creature with an attached echeneis takes a cumulative \u20131 penalty to Dexterity each round (which stacks with multiple echeneises) and must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be affected as if by a <i>slow</i> spell until the end of the echeneis\u2019s next turn. The penalty to Dexterity ends at the end of the echeneis\u2019s turn if it is no longer attached to the creature. A vehicle with an attached echeneis has its speed reduced by half until the end of the echeneis\u2019s next turn. A creature or vehicle slowed by a second echeneis is reduced to one-quarter speed. A creature or vehicle slowed by three or more echeneises is reduced to a speed of 0 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based."
