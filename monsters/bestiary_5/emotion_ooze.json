            "html": "Truly bizarre and alien creatures, emotion oozes are made of ectoplasm that has somehow been granted the spark of life. Though they can\u2019t be categorized as intelligent, emotion oozes have a unique emotional empathy, allowing them not only to respond and react to the emotions of nearby creatures, but also to psychically shape and alter the emotions of others.<br/><br/> Though they are carnivorous, emotion oozes prefer to seek out victims with strong emotions, on which they also feed. As a part of their unnatural biology, they gain a physiological benefit from being exposed to strong emotions. Each emotion ooze is attuned to a specific emotion, and the cause of this connection is unclear. The most commonly accepted theory is that the oozes imprint on the first strong emotion that they are exposed to or that the emotion is imprinted in the ectoplasm, though others believe that the creatures have some control over this bond, and can even change the emotion they\u2019re attuned to given enough time. In addition to their coloration ref lecting their attuned emotions, emotion ooze takes on forms that befit the emotion to which they are tied, making it fairly easy for those with knowledge of the creatures to determine each one\u2019s particular emotional attunement on first glance.<br/><br/> Creatures that encounter an emotion ooze find that it mimics their expressions and movements in an unnerving manner, sometimes even duplicating the facial features of the creature as it mimics a smile or growl. The ooze\u2019s reactions get more extreme when creatures around it express the type of emotion to which the ooze is attuned. The ooze begins to noticeably ripple, pulsing in a sympathetic rhythm and reshaping itself more rapidly than it does when it is on the search for emotional creatures. An anger-attuned ooze might form its pseudopods to look more like jagged spikes, and a despair ooze might reach out fitfully like a creature struggling to escape from a pool of quicksand.<br/><br/> Most animals and unintelligent life forms find an emotion ooze\u2019s imitation and emotional echoes terrifying and flee as quickly as possible. Though some sentient creatures have this same reaction, others find the phenomenon fascinating, and attempt to either experiment with or capture emotion oozes, putting themselves within reach of the hungry oozes\u2019 grasp. These intelligent creatures are the most common victims of emotion ooze attacks.<br/><br/> Pitched battles draw the attentions of emotion oozes attuned to anger, fear, hatred, or zeal. Such an ooze might join a nearby battle it senses so it can feed off the emotions generated there. The desire to continue causing and absorbing such strong feelings causes the ooze to try to prolong the battle, spreading out its attacks among multiple targets and paying little attention to creatures that aren\u2019t affected by its ability to compel emotion. In the end, the ooze\u2019s hunger might actually be its downfall.<br/><br/> Emotion oozes often dwell in places where strong emotions were felt in the past, suggesting the creatures might have latent psychometric ability. Hatred oozes might live at the sites of massacres, zeal oozes in old temples or political offices, despair oozes in ancient prisons, and so on. If stuck in one place or deprived of emotional connections for a long time, an emotion ooze begins to lose its coloration, becoming a dull white, and eventually hardens and cracks into pieces.<br/><br/> The typical emotion ooze has about the same volume as a human, but its composition makes it significantly lighter, weighing only around 50 pounds."

A creature affected by an anger-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability is compelled to take attacks of opportunity against its allies whenever those allies take actions that would provoke an attack of opportunity from a creature. These count against the number of attacks of opportunity the creature can take each round.<br/><br/><i>Dedication</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to dedication is a deep blue. Its Constitution score increases by 4, it gains <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Great%20Fortitude\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Great Fortitude</a> and <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Toughness\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Toughness</a> as bonus feats, and its natural armor bonus to AC increases by 2. A creature affected by a dedication-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability is unable to move away from an adjacent opponent unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn. Success allows the creature to move away that round, but does not end the effect.<br/><br/><i>Despair</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to despair is a pale, listless gray. Its Constitution and Charisma scores increase by 2, and it has DR 10/magic and cold resistance 10. A creature affected by a despair-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability takes a \u20134 morale penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls.<br/><br/><i>Fear</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to fear is light gray, flecked with darker gray motes swirling about its insides. Its Dexterity score increases by 4, it gains <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Initiative\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Improved Initiative</a> and <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lightning%20Reflexes\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Lightning Reflexes</a> as bonus feats, and it gains the evasion rogue class feature. A creature affected by a fearattuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability gains the shaken condition.<br/><br/><i>Hatred</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to hatred is a deep black color, which pulsates violently when it attacks. Its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by 2, it has acid resistance 10, and its emotional scarring ability deals an additional 4d6 points of damage (instead of 3d6). A creature affected by a hatred-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability takes a \u20134 penalty to AC, but gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.<br/><br/><i>Jealousy</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to jealousy is a swirl of oily green, orange, and brownish red. Its Strength and Dexterity scores increase by 2, and it has DR 5/silver and SR 17. A creature affected by a jealousy-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability must attempt saving throws to resist all spells cast on it, including harmless and beneficial spells.<br/><br/><i>Zeal</i>: An emotion ooze attuned to zeal is a bright orange color, and grows brighter when the ooze is feeding or has recently fed. Its Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom scores increase by 2, and it has DR 5/magic and electricity resistance 10. A creature affected by a zeal-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability must succeed at a DC 20 Will save each round or repeat the same actions it took on the previous round. If it is unable to do so (such as if it made a full attack against an opponent that has moved away, or cast a spell that has been expended), it must take actions that mimic those taken in the previous round as closely as possible. Succeeding at this Will save allows the creature to act normally for 1 round, but does not free it from the emotion effect."

Though an emotion ooze is otherwise immune to mind-affecting effects, it is healed by emotion effects that match its emotion, regaining a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect (or to the ooze's Hit Dice for abilities with no caster level). The ooze takes an equal amount of damage if it fails a saving throw against an effect that specifically counters its corresponding emotion (for instance, remove fear for fear or good hope for despair)."
