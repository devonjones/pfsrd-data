It hunts in subterranean tunnels and even city sewer systems and waterways for animal and vegetable material to consume. Thick, viscous, and resembling a glistening spread of black wax, roiling oil moves slowly across f lat surfaces and up walls to find prey it can batter with its greasy pseudopods. When a patch of roiling oil attacks, the process of stretching and shifting its form to strike exposes portions of its interior mass to oxygen. This interaction creates a pungent odor of oil and rancid fat. A roiling oil\u2019s strikes slather its targets in an equally malodorous film capable of overwhelming victims with nausea. A roiling oil prefers to fully coat its prey in this substance before it kills and devours them. Even more dangerous, however, is the fact that creatures attempting to burn away a roiling oil only make it more lethal. Even the smallest spark or f lame can turn this voracious ooze into a moving inferno against which only cold or strong wind act as any protection. The ooze itself feels no pain from the f lames and isn\u2019t impeded by them, but such attempts can result in burns to everyone and everything else in the area."

When lit, a roiling oil loses its nauseating film ability but its slam attack deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit and the ooze gains the burn special attack (Reflex DC 21 negates). Both DCs are Constitution-based. While ablaze, the roiling oil gives off smoke that creates concealment in the roiling oil\u2019s space and 5 feet beyond. This smoke functions like a <i>fog cloud</i> in the range indicated. Water does not extinguish the flames, but any cold damage or a <i>gust of wind</i> or similar effect smothers the flames. Otherwise, a roiling oil burns for 1 minute before returning to its original state. While the ooze is ablaze, any additional fire or electricity damage extends the duration but doesn\u2019t cause additional explosions."
